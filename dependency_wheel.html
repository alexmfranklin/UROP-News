    "text": "The School of Engineering of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is launching a new undergraduate program in Bioengineering that offers students the opportunity to conduct research in elite overseas universities, and at the same time nurtures leaders in biomedical technology and big data in support of the Hong Kong government\u2019s focused effort to spearhead the development of these fields. Prof Ying Chau, Associate Professor and Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, said, \u201cThe Bioengineering Program takes a molecular-level perspective to tackle healthcare issues. For instance, the curriculum contains modules on biomaterials design, pharmaceutical engineering, and genome analysis.\u201d The Bioengineering Program is taught by a number of rising stars in bioengineering research who are at the forefront of innovation. Prof Angela Wu, Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, is designing microfluidic devices that can capture and manipulate cells for different purposes including single-cell genomic analysis. While each microfluidic device can be used to investigate cells from a variety of organisms including bacteria, animals, and plants, one of Prof Wu\u2019s main research focuses is studying tumor initiation in human beings, with the goal of understanding and preventing cancer. Prof Terence Wong, Assistant Professor in the same Department, is developing a novel microscope that can determine whether any cancer cells remain in a cancer patient after an initial resection within minutes. This is a tremendous improvement on the current pathological procedures, which typically take as much as a week, resulting in some cases in the need of performing a second surgery to remove the remaining cancer cells. Both Prof Wu and Prof Wong are making a significant difference to human health. The Bioengineering Program will be launched in the Fall Semester in 2018. Students have to register for the HKUST Engineering program (JUPAS catalog no.: JS5200) within the JUPAS program choices modification period (July 12-14) in order to get into the major. Prof Ying Chau said, \u201cWe take tremendous pride in offering this Bioengineering Program, as we are putting students on the cutting edge of engineering research, and preparing them for significant contributions to mankind.\u201d For program details, please visit <https://cbe.ust.hk/academic/ug_obj_bioe.html>.

    "date": "3-7-2018",
    "text": "A research team from the State Key Laboratory on Advanced Displays and Optoelectronics Technologies of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has developed a new Liquid-crystal display (LCD), which image resolution, energy efficiency as well as color saturation were markedly enhanced, achieving a crucial breakthrough in display technology. Known as Active Matrix Ferroelectric Liquid Crystal Display (FLCD) \u2013 this latest technology developed by a research team led by Chair Professor from the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering Prof Kwok Hoi-Sing, will see energy efficiency jumped by 3-5 times, and image resolution enhanced by three times \u2013 at a lowered cost. Conventional displays have limited energy efficiency, as color filters block and consume 70% of the backlight and energy.\u00a0 To replace color filters, the team developed a field sequential color technology \u2013 enabled by fast ferroelectric liquid crystal, which allows display of color images \u00a0sequentially in time.\u00a0 This technology relies on human vision to fuse these fast-switching images into a full-color picture, so color filters are no longer necessary.\u00a0 As color filters usually make up 30% of a display\u2019s manufacturing cost, its removal result in a cheaper cost of this higher quality FLCD in comparison to its traditional counterparts. Color saturation of the new display is also boosted as the team adopted RGB LED for the backlight instead of the commonly used LED. \u00a0RGB LED\u2019s narrow spectrum contributes to wider color gamut (ranges of color), allowing FLCD to outperform any display alternatives available today.\u00a0 Its image resolution also increased by three times as the sub-pixels for different colors are removed. \u201cThe FLCD requires relatively low power consumption, so it is highly suitable for portable electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, which batteries can live longer than they do now.\u00a0 The new display could also be applied in high-end displays such as virtual reality headsets and head-mounted displays with its higher resolution and color performance,\u201d Prof\u00a0Kwok said. Developed in collaboration with AU Optronics (AUO) from Taiwan, Prof Kwok\u2019s team has recently won the \u201cBest Prototype in Innovation Zone\u201d award with this new technology from The Society for Information Display. About The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\u00a0\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (www.ust.hk) is a world-class research university focuses on science, technology and business as well as humanities and social science. \u00a0HKUST offers an international campus, and a holistic and interdisciplinary pedagogy to nurture well-rounded graduates with global vision, a strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking.\u00a0 HKUST attained the highest proportion of internationally excellent research work in the Research Assessment Exercise 2014 of Hong Kong\u2019s University Grants Committee, and is ranked as the world\u2019s best young university in Times Higher Education\u2019s Young University Rankings 2018.\u00a0 Its graduates were ranked 12th worldwide and top in Greater China in Global Employability University Survey 2017. \u00a0 "

    "text": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is pushing forward its public policy research and education as the Institute for Public Policy (IPP) published today the first report on the integrative development of innovation and technology (I&T) in the Greater Bay Area, and the University is set to launch the city\u2019s first two-year full-time taught postgraduate public policy program specialized in science, technology and environmental policy. The latest research project \u2013 jointly conducted by Chinese Academy of Engineering, Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences and IPP \u2013 has highlighted the risks faced by Hong Kong if we do not speed up in I&T, and made a number of suggestions on what the government should do. \u00a0The report argued, for example, that the government\u2019s laissez-faire policy is out-of-date, so it must take the lead with regard to R&D investment, training and policy development to foster I&T for small companies.\u00a0 The report also identified strategic areas that Hong Kong and the Greater Bay cities should strengthen collaborations in. On the education side, starting September 2018, HKUST is launching a new two-year full-time Master program in Public Policy (MPP), which offers not just solid knowledge on policy analysis using data analytics, but also leadership and management skills through internships and real-life practices in government agencies, non-profit organizations and private sector entities. \u00a0The program also includes a client-based capstone project, where students will work in teams to find solutions for real-life challenges facing public and private organizations. \u00a0MPP is the first two-year full-time postgraduate program in Hong Kong that allows students to focus on policy-making and analysis in science, innovation, technology and environmental sectors \u2013 all fast-rising fields in urgent need of a large amount of talents, amid opportunities posted by initiatives such as the establishment of the Lok Ma Chau Hi-Tech Park and the Greater Bay Area. The degree requires the completion of 48 credit hours which are evenly divided between a core curriculum in public policy, and elective courses which allow students to broaden their perspectives by taking a diverse range of courses from the University\u2019s five schools. An information session about the program will be held in HKUST Business Central on 21 May. \u201cWhile advancements of science and technology have been rapidly expanding the range of solutions for tackling global challenges such as climate change and ageing,\u201d said Prof Xun Wu, Acting Head of the Division of Public Policy (PPOL) at HKUST where the program is offered. \u201cSuch innovative solutions have also given rise to a complex set of ethical, institutional and legal issues for governments, non-profit and private entities. Public policy will thus play an increasingly important role in unlocking the full potential of science and technology in improving our everyday lives and achieving sustainable development of our society.\u201d IPP has drawn on the expertise and connection from world-class faculty across HKUST \u2013 consisting leading scholars and advisers of national and international corporations and government bodies.\u00a0 They include former Secretary for Transport and Housing Prof Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, now a Visiting Professor of the Institute of Public Policy (IPP) of HKUST, who will help organize high-level forums and platforms to facilitate policy exchanges and research at HKUST. \u00a0For example, a seminar on the Greater Bay Area development from a \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d perspective was held last Friday by IPP to shed light on how this unique governance model could go forward as part of the \u201cGreater Bay Area Initiative\u201d.

    "text": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) is launching a transformative new degree program in Integrative Systems and Design (ISD), which will revolutionize traditional teaching method as students will study systems design not through fixed curriculum, but project-based learning in teams where the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d to learn are individualized. Commencing in the fall term of 2018, the new program does not target merely academic high scorers, but those who display exceptional talent and learning potential in specific subject areas. During the four-year curriculum hosted by the Division of Integrative Systems and Design, these students \u2013 under the guidance of dedicated faculty and mentorship from the Division\u2019s industrial partners, will take open-ended team-based projects to build their knowledge in design and systems thinking, specific technology strength and entrepreneurial spirit through learning-by-doing. The students can choose their own means in acquiring the necessary knowledge \u2013 whether by taking regular, MOOCs, online or flip-classroom courses, or even self-study. \u201cScience and technology advance exponentially. It has enabled a new era of disruptive innovations that create new markets and value networks to drive national economic growth. A good example of game-changing innovation is smart phone that has changed our lifestyle dramatically. The birth of disruptive innovations requires both cutting-edge science and engineering advancement and innovators who could integrate know-hows that span different disciplines in a user-oriented and human-centered mindset. To nurture such innovators, engineering education should have a function of incubator for the entrepreneurial talents. To fulfill this mission, we need a more interactive and student-oriented pedagogy \u2013 one that encourages active learning and could adapt to the student\u2019s inherent interests and strengths to unlock their innovation potential,\u201d said Prof Wu Jingshen, Acting Head of Division of ISD. Established under the School of Engineering, the Division aims to nurture students\u2019 technological competence, critical thinking ability and necessary business sense through team-based projects.\u00a0 Moreover, the Division will also facilitate interactions among faculty of different disciplines in order to spark new ideas and collaborations. Supporting our efforts, senior executives and engineers from like-minded industries including DJI, Philips, Dyson, Tencent and Analog Devices will be invited to participate in the program by offering industrial and market perspectives for the students\u2019 projects, as well as invaluable internship opportunities. The program is a significant step forward in HKUST\u2019s commitment to enhance self-learning since the University launched a tri-model education framework in 2013, putting experiential learning and student-led courses as one of the three throngs in such approach, in addition to a well-rounded curriculum and accelerated courses.

    "text": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) expanded its eighth annual One Million Dollar Entrepreneurship Competition to two more cities in China, making the total number of cities holding this competition to seven. Meanwhile, HKUST will introduce new initiatives for its one million dollar entrepreneurship competition in Hong Kong this year, in a bid to enhance diversity and experience of the participants, as well as facilitating public engagement in this contest. Thanks to the generous support of Sino Group, the annual signature contest of HKUST is renamed HKUST-Sino One Million Dollar Entrepreneurship Competition 2018 this year for the Hong Kong station. Over the past few years, the competition has eventually grown from a platform to nurture promising entrepreneurs at HKUST, into a regional contest after launching in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Macau in 2016. This year, HKUST takes the competition to the next level by introducing it in Foshan and Zhongshan \u2013 covering a total of 6 other cities in the Greater Bay Area. Increasing the scale of the competition does not only reinforce the collaboration between UST and other cities in the Greater Bay Area, but also foster interaction, promote creativity and advancement among entrepreneurs in China. In Hong Kong\u2019s competition, 24 contestants \u2013 double that of last year, will be allowed to join a round called the Elevator Pitch where each team gets to pitch their business proposals in 90 seconds, similar to the duration of a lift ride, which is a real life mimic met by many startups. To facilitate public\u2019s participation in entrepreneurial events, HKUST will introduce for the first time an online public voting session, where the public gets to select the better performers out of the 24 Elevator Pitch contestants, whose performance will be posted online. The public voting results will contribute 10% of the scores for the Elevator Pitch Award. HKUST will also set up an Online Matching Platform to help match participants with interested parties from across and outside of Hong Kong. Prof Gary Chan, Director of the University\u2019s Entrepreneurship Center, said the move was to foster diversity, \u201cWe see the importance of bringing young entrepreneurs with different backgrounds together to exchange ideas.

    "text": "A research team led by scientists from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has identified new Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) genetic risk factors in the Chinese population. The team, led by Prof Nancy Ip, Vice-President for Research and Graduate Studies, Director of the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience and The Morningside Professor of Life Science at HKUST, conducted the study in collaboration with Prof John Hardy and Dr Mok Kin Ying from University College London; Prof Li Yun from the University of North Carolina; Prof Chen Yu from the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and the HKUST Shenzhen Research Institute; and Prof Guo Qihao from Huashan Hospital and Fudan University. AD is the most common and best known form of dementia, and one of the leading causes of mortality in the elderly. It is a progressive age-related neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neurological inflammation, which result in cognitive decline and neuronal loss in the brain. Although the prevalence of AD is increasing rapidly with the growing aging population worldwide, the underlying causes of the disease are still unclear, which is a major challenge for effective diagnosis and treatment. Understanding the genetic contributions to AD \u2013 by identifying disease-associated genetic risk factors, is essential for deciphering the causes of the disease. Because these genetic risk factors may vary among ethnic groups, genetic studies across different ethnic populations are critical. However, to date, majority of these studies have been conducted in Caucasian populations, and there is relatively little data for other populations. This study is one of the first to investigate the genetic contributions to AD in the Chinese population. By conducting the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study in a Chinese AD cohort comprising thousands of participants, the team identified genetic factors associated with AD. The researchers identified variants of a well-studied genetic marker, APOE, as well as two other novel risk genes (GCH1 and KCNJ15) associated with AD. They also discovered that these risk factors are associated with the alteration of immune pathways, specifically changes in immune biomarkers in the brain and blood. These findings provide critical new evidence of the role of the immune system in AD pathology. The ground-breaking work has been published in the prestigious scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). This study serves as Prof Ip\u2019s Inaugural Article for PNAS. The Inaugural Articles comprise a special series of research articles contributed by newly elected members of the National Academy of Sciences (profile of Prof Ip: http://www.pnas.org/content/115/8/1675). \u201cSystematic studies of AD-associated biomarkers can facilitate a deeper understanding of the cause of AD and provide insights for developing improved diagnostics and therapies for AD,\u201d said Prof Ip. \u201cOur next goal is to establish a comprehensive biomarker database for Chinese AD patients, including genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and brain imaging data, by broadening our collaboration with academics and physicians.\u201d This project was generously supported by the University Grants Committee, the Research Grants Council, the Innovation and Technology Commission, National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. Prof Nancy Ip is currently the Vice-President for Research and Graduate Studies, The Morningside Professor of Life Science, and the Director of the State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience at HKUST. Since joining HKUST in 1993, she has served as Dean of Science, Director of the Biotechnology Research Institute, and Head of the Department of Biochemistry. Prof Ip\u2019s outstanding scientific accomplishments have won her numerous awards and honors including the National Natural Science Awards, the L\u2019OREAL-UNESCO \u2018For Women in Science\u2019 Award, and the 10 Science Stars of China by Nature.

    "text": "Researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) have identified for the first time the culprit behind the causing of broad-spectrum bacterial resistance to peptide antibiotics \u2013 widely perceived as the last-line of defense against antibiotic-resistant bacteria, opening a new direction to the design of new drugs in tackling superbugs. The discovery \u2013 made by Chair Professor from the Division of Life Science Prof Qian Pei-Yuan and his fellow researchers, came in the best moment as the team has also discovered that this enzyme, which they identified as the cause of broad-spectrum bacteria resistance against peptide antibiotics, was actually found in not just a few, but many different strains of bacteria, sounding an alarm against persistent improper use of antibiotics. Peptide antibiotics \u2013 including vancomycin and polymyxin for respective treatment of Staphylococcus Aureus (CA-MRSA) Infection and Escherichia coil infection, are often used as the last resort due to their resilience to multidrug resistant bacteria.\u00a0 However, a few years ago scientists have started identifying a few types of peptide antibiotics which have developed symptoms of bacterial resistance, although the causes behind remained unknown.\u00a0 Now, following the analysis of over 6,000 bacteria genomes under repeated validation through gene editing, chemical and enzymatic analyses, Prof Qian\u2019s team eventually identified a family of D-stereospecific resistance peptidases (DRPs) as the source of the problem, and its magnitude extends well beyond a few strains of bacteria. \u201cDRPs are phylogenetically widely distributed in nature, if they are transferred to opportunistic pathogens with human\u2019s increasing misuse and overuse\u00a0of\u00a0antibiotics, more and more peptide antibiotics would be rendered useless, leading to delay or even failure in treatment,\u201d said Prof Qian, also David von Hansemann Professor of Science as well as Acting Head of the Department of Ocean Science at HKUST. \u2018Misuse and overuse of antibiotics of humans will intensify the problem of antibiotic resistance of pathogens, that makes research on peptide antibiotics even more important,\u201d he added. \u201cDeepening our understanding of antibiotic resistance mechanisms to peptide antibiotics does not only serve as a wake-up call, but is also conducive to increasing our collective antibiotic arsenal. The findings of DRPs is just the beginning, we hope it will lead to more research on the use and development of peptide antibiotics.\u201d The findings were recently published in the scientific journal Nature Chemical Biology.

    "text": "A research team from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has discovered a more efficient and eco-friendly way to produce a family of chiral molecules, which would potentially bring down the cost of chiral medicine and make them more accessible to all. Over half of the approved drugs now in use in the world are chiral, which treats a wide range of conditions including cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases.\u00a0 Many chiral drugs are top sellers including high-cholesterol medicine Lipitor, and antibiotic Amoxicillin.\u00a0 But production of chiral drugs are difficult and costly, as the production process is complicated and requires rare and expensive raw materials in general. Now, a team led by Prof Jianwei Sun, Associate Professor of the Department of Chemistry, discovered useful methods that could result in a more efficient and affordable production of the drugs. \u201cChiral molecules contain subunits which are like \u2018twin brothers\u2019, they have extremely similar, mirror-like architecture but may exhibit distinct traits in our body,\u201d said Prof Sun. \u201cThese \u2018twin components\u2019 are particularly hard to separate, and it is costly to get just the useful part out of the two, Chiral allenes represents an example of this type which were made by the very expensive chiral raw materials.\u201d Prof Sun\u2019s team, however, has discovered that chiral allenes can be produced through organic catalysis using racemic propargylic alcohols, which is cheap and easy to come by, the catalyst is also recyclable and reusable without having to create metal wastes. \u201cOur method is not only more economical and friendly to the environment, such green catalysis could also have profound impact in health care as drug companies may be able to create and develop chiral drugs in a cheaper and more sustainable way,\u201d said Prof Sun. The findings were recently published in Nature Communications. Chiral drugs have a fast growing market. The market size has jumped nearly four folds to around US$800 billion over the past decade and is still growing. Last year, more than two thirds of the newly developing drugs are made of chiral molecules.

The Campaign signifies the joint efforts of City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University, Lingnan University, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, The Education University of Hong Kong, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and The University of Hong Kong to reduce plastic waste. The universities will hold a \u201cNo Straw Week\u201d or \u201cNo Straw Day\u201d on their campuses during the week of March 12-16, where campus catering outlets will only offer straws when requested. Other activities include film screenings, zero waste markets and reusable straw giveaways. The universities have also pledged to introduce long-term measures including regular awareness campaigns and no straw days, or a campus-wide ban of plastic straws. The aim of the campaign is to reduce disposable plastic waste and raise awareness in the higher education sector and beyond in Hong Kong. The campaign builds on the idea that eight universities together will generate a greater impact, building on the effort by individual institutions on campus plastic waste reduction. The pioneering No Straw University initiative at Hong Kong Baptist University and an earlier No Straw Week at The University of Hong Kong resulted in the reduction of plastic straws by 90 \u2013 95%. \u201cI am pleased to see eight Hong Kong universities join together in the UNIfy: Skip the Straw campaign\u201d said Prof Mark McGinley, Director of Core Curriculum and General Education and Professor & Head of the Science Unit at Lingnan University, the Convenor of the 2018 Hong Kong Sustainable Campus Consortium.\u00a0 \u201cWorking together we can gain inspiration and ideas for best practices from our partner universities and can act as a significant catalyst for change.\u201d The campaign is supported and organized by the Hong Kong Sustainable Campus Consortium (HKSCC), a platform for higher education institutions in Hong Kong to promote knowledge exchange and discussion towards a sustainable future.

The findings \u2013 discovered by a team of undergraduate and postgraduate students led by Prof Karen Chan, Assistant Professor from the Division of Life Science at HKUST \u2013 have shown for the first time that the detrimental effects of microplastics \u2013 tiny plastic pellets found in many health, beauty and household products, are not confined to only upscale, commonly consumed marine invertebrates like abalones and oysters, but also take a toll on tough invasive and nuisance species like the slipper limpets. If these common slipper limpets were exposed to a high concentration of microbeads during their larval stage, they would not resume their original growth rates even after the removal of microbeads from their surroundings. \u201cOur research has shown that a high concentration of microplastics has a long-lasting and irremediable negative impact on the slipper limpets. However, these snails are unfazed by microplastics at an environmental concentration similar to that in Hong Kong waters. If they are more resilient than other native species, the invasive snails could further threaten the local species\u2019 survival and ecological balance,\u201d said Prof Chan. \u201cDespite all the adverse impacts these minute plastic pollutants have on the marine ecosystems, they are still being used in many personal care products around the world \u2013 including here in Hong Kong.\u201d Some governments \u2013 such as that in Canada[1] and the UK[2], have banned the use of microplastics, but it is still legal in many developed countries including Germany and Japan. In Hong Kong, up to 9.4 billion microbeads are being released to our coastal waters every day[3]. Worldwide, an estimated 15 to 51 trillion microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean as of 2016[4]. \u201cTo help save our ocean, we should start with ourselves today. Avoid products with microplastics, think twice before consuming single-use plastics such as straws, bottled drinks as they do degrade into small pieces, and spread the word \u2013 do something before it is too late,\u201d Prof Chan pleaded. The team\u2019s other findings on bristle worms have shown that the regeneration rate of their tail is much reduced under exposure to a high concentration of microbeads, and such regenerative ability is crucial for their survival. Smaller beads (8-12 micrometers in diameter) were also found to be more detrimental than larger ones. The team\u2019s findings were recently published in the scientific journals Environmental Pollution and Marine Pollution Bulletin.

    "text": "A research team at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) recently invented a new fusion-based technology which achieves remarkably improved accuracy to position people indoor, enabling novel smart location-based applications such as indoor navigation, location-based personalized recommendation, crowd analysis and people flow control. Developed by a team led by Prof Gary Chan of the Department of the Computer Science and Engineering, the location sensing technology \u2013 a software suite which fuses Wi-Fi with other signals on mobile platforms \u2013 is the first of its kind deployed in Hong Kong. It could reduce the position error to less than 2.5 meters in general environment, three times more accurate than traditional approaches. To locate a person, the technology combines signals from multiple sources such as Wi-Fi, geomagnetic field, Bluetooth, video and accelerometer reading. It has been deployed in Harbour City at Tsim Sha Tsui, and is now under commercial trials in malls (in collaboration with New World Development Research and Development, PCCW Solutions, and Link) and hospitals. \u201cExisting location-based technologies often draw signals from a single source. As different signals have different limitations, their accuracy is not so satisfactory and their application environment is not general enough,\u201d said Prof Chan, also Director of Entrepreneurship Center at HKUST. \u201cOur technology is to fuse the signals to combine their strengths while overcoming their limitations. The higher location accuracy makes possible novel location-based services and facilitates Hong Kong\u2019s development as a smart city.\u201d The technology can also create synergy with the government\u2019s smart lamp posts pilot scheme announced earlier as an initiative of the Smart City Blueprint[1], which plans to install multifunctional smart lamp posts starting 2019 to facilitate collection of real-time city data in enhancing city management and other public services. Incorporated with the technology, the lamp posts will not only provide timely location-based services to tourists and general public, but will also create immense social value on helping to find missing people, pets and preventing them from getting lost. Funded by the Innovation and Technology Commission\u2019s Innovation and Technology Fund and managed by Hong Kong R&D Centre for Logistics and Supply Chain Management Enabling Technologies (LSCM R&D Center), Prof Chan\u2019s technology is now being commercialized through two start-ups run by HKUST graduates. The fusion technology is based on fingerprinting. Survey is first conducted to collect the signals at different locations of a given site. Using machine learning, the signal\u2019s characteristics at these locations are analyzed and modeled. Upon detecting signals from a user, the location of the user can then be estimated accurately and efficiently. Patents of the technology have been filed in the US and mainland China.

    "text": "An international multi-disciplinary research team led by scientists at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has discovered for the first time a computational framework that could map out the fitness landscape of a crucial protein in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), potentially paving the way for rational design of a vaccine that may force the deadly virus to mutate into forms that lead to its demise. Despite significant advances in medicine, an effective vaccine for HIV is still not available, although recent hope has emerged through the discovery of antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse HIV. The virus, however, can still evade known broadly neutralizing antibody responses via mutational pathways, which makes it all the more difficult to design an effective solution. Now, Prof Matthew McKay and Prof Raymond Louie from HKUST have come up with a possible solution together with Prof Arup Chakraborty and his group members from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology \u2013 using big data analysis. The team employed a computational approach to estimate the fitness landscape of the polyprotein gp160 that comprises HIV\u2019s surface spikes. The fitness landscape is a mapping from sequence to fitness, where fitness refers to the ability of the virus to properly assemble, replicate, and propagate infection. Knowledge of the fitness landscape can give scientists important clues as to which part of the virus\u2019 spike proteins they should target, so as to corner the virus to mutate into forms that would severely compromise its fitness and its ability to reproduce and replicate. Prof McKay is the Hari Harilela Associate Professor in the Departments of Electronic & Computer Engineering and Chemical & Biological Engineering; Prof Louie is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering and Junior Fellow of HKUST Institute for Advanced Study. Their findings were published in the prestigious scientific journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA (PNAS) last month. \u201cWithout big data, it is simply impossible to make such prediction,\u201d said Prof Louie. \u201cThe number of parameters needed to be estimated came close to 4.4 million.\u201d Prof McKay highlighted that the computational method offers fast and accurate results. \u201cThe findings can assist biologists in proposing new immunogens and vaccination protocols that seek to force the virus to mutate to unfit states in order to evade immune responses, which is likely to thwart or limit viral infection,\u201d he said. \u201cBeyond the application to HIV-gp160, our approach may also be useful for identifying fitness landscapes for proteins of other highly mutable viruses, such as Hepatitis C.\u201d Mapping of the HIV envelope protein gp160 is more challenging than other HIV proteins as its primary sequence is more than twice as long as its peers and is amongst the most variable. The team processed data consisting of 815 residues and 20,043 sequences from 1,918 HIV-infected individuals. They then verified the inferred landscape through comparisons with diverse experimental measurements. As of September 2017, the cumulative total number of reported HIV infections in Hong Kong is 8,952[1], while globally an estimated 36.7 million people were living with HIV in 2016[2].

    "text": "An interdisciplinary team of scientists from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has discovered the mechanism of how human brains turn on and off neuronal activities, providing an important foundation to understand a wide range of neurologic conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease and ataxia-telangiectasia diseases. \u201cAs with all things in life, healthy brain function depends on a balance of neuronal activities. We think of our brains as active \u2013 moving a leg and saying a word are all \u201cactive\u201d events, but it is just as important that our brains be able to stop these actions,\u201d said Cheng Aifang, a postgraduate student from the Division of Life Science who made the discovery under the guidance of the division\u2019s head and Chair Professor Karl Herrup. \u201cYet it was not clear how our brains actually perform this go/stop function until now.\u201d The team discovered that the brain balances excitation and inhibition through regulating ATM and ATR \u2013 large kinase enzymes, levels.\u00a0 In pathological conditions, when ATM levels drop for example, ATR levels increase, vice versa. \u00a0In addition, the team also discovered that ATM only regulates excitatory synaptic vesicles while ATR is responsible for only the inhibitory ones. \u00a0This is achieved by controlling the movement of these tiny synaptic vesicles in the neuronal synapse \u2013 the gap between two neurons that regulates information flow in the brain. \u201cThe discoveries are in the realm of basic research, but they have important implications for human disease\u201d said Prof Karl Herrup, also director of the Super-Resolution Imaging Center (SRIC). \u201cEpilepsy, for example, is a condition where one of the problems is that inhibition fails. As our findings would predict, humans with too little ATR have a problem with epilepsy, while people with ATM deficiency by contrast are ataxic \u2013 a reduced ability to make finely controlled movements and keep the proper E/I ratio. This means that there is a yin-yang relationship between ATM and ATR. \u00a0And this is only the beginning. We believe that our work has potential relevance to a much broader range of neurologic conditions.\u201d The findings were published in the Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences earlier this month. Utilizing super-resolution microscopy offered by at HKUST, the researchers were able to view the cellular location of the two kinases at ultra-high magnification.\u00a0 The custom designed super-resolution microscope with active stage locking provided the stability needed to obtain high-resolution images. \u201cOne of the challenges we faced was that even at high magnification, all vesicles look pretty much alike,\u201d said Prof Du Shengwang, physics professor and Associate Director of SRIC.\u00a0 \u201cTo provide differentiation, we developed a three-color version of our super-resolution system, which allowed the team to prove that ATM and ATR were never found on the same VAMP2-containing synaptic vesicle.\u201d About The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\u00a0\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (www.ust.hk) is a world-class research university focuses on science, technology and business as well as humanities and social science. \u00a0HKUST offers an international campus, and a holistic and interdisciplinary pedagogy to nurture well-rounded graduates with global vision, a strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking.

    "text": "A research team led by awards-winning neuroscientist and structural biologist Prof Zhang Mingjie of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has recently reached a breakthrough unveiling the fundamental mechanism that causes schizophrenia and other serious psychiatric conditions.\u00a0 Such discovery may potentially lead to the development of new treatments and drugs for the mental disorders. At present, there are about 40,000 diagnosed schizophrenic patients in Hong Kong [1]. Mutations of DISC1 encoding gene \u2013 a human gene that regulates various cellular activities including neurogenesis, or the birth of neurons \u2013 are known to be associated with major psychiatric disorders for over a decade.\u00a0 However, how the DISC1 protein interacts with many other proteins to impact human brain development has remained unknown until recently, Prof Zhang and his team uncovered the never before known high-resolution structure of DISC1 protein in complex with Ndel1 \u2013 a vital protein for neurogenesis and many other aspects of brain functions.\u00a0 The team found that if the formation of DISC1/Ndel1 complex was disrupted by mutations of DISC1 gene, neurogenesis will be delayed and thus may cause mental disorders. Their findings were just published in a leading neuroscience journal Neuron on December 7, 2017. \u201cWe uncovered a new mechanism of action for DISC1 gene based on its structure, and offered implications of how genetic insults may contribute to schizophrenia and other serious psychiatric disorders,\u201d said Prof Zhang, Kerry Holdings Professor of Science of the Division of Life Science at HKUST. \u00a0\u201cSometimes, a basic research finding may seem too far off from clinical implementations. However, these little steps that we and many other scientists are now taking, are fundamental to the laying of foundations for future medical applications that will help save millions of lives,\u201d said Prof Zhang. \u00a0When Marie Curie, the first woman and the first two-times Nobel Prize winner discovered radium, she was not considering the use of this element, nonetheless it eventually led to the development of chemotherapy which until now remains an important treatment for cancer patients. Spanning across broad research areas and taking about eight years to complete, Prof Zhang\u2019s multifaceted schizophrenia research received sponsorship from the Research Grants Council as part of the stem cell strategy for nervous system disorders project under the second round exercise of the Theme-based Research Scheme.\u00a0 World-leading neuronal stem cell biologists from the University of Pennsylvania have contributed to the paper using a novel 3D cell culture modelling technology to produce human brain organoids derived from schizophrenia patients. \u201cThe DISC1/Ndel1 structure and their interaction during neurogenesis in animal models and schizophrenia patient-derived human forebrain organoids provide a potential pathological understanding of complex psychiatric disorders that may help the development of new treatments and drugs,\u201d said Dr Ye Fei, Research Assistant Professor at Prof Zhang\u2019s team and a lead author of the paper. Prof Zhang has long been focusing on the investigation into human brain\u2019s development and growth.\u00a0 His efforts have been recognized by the prestigious New York-based Simons Foundation, which has recently granted him US$720,000 for a 3-year research project that aims to study the gene-protein interactions which are closely related to autism.\u00a0 Locally, Prof Zhang received last week the well-respected Croucher Senior Research Fellow Award 2018-19, he will dedicate the reward to the study of the formation mechanism of synapses \u2013 the basic unit of neuronal circuits in the brain, that could pave the way for future drug development in curing mental illnesses. About The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (www.ust.hk) is a world-class research university focuses on science, technology and business as well as humanities and social science. \u00a0HKUST offers an international campus, and a holistic and interdisciplinary pedagogy to nurture well-rounded graduates with global vision, a strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking.

    "text": "Prof Ba Shusong, Chief China Economist of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) and Chief Economist of China Banking Association, presented a gripping lecture on Hong Kong\u2019s role as a global financial center in facilitating renminbi-denominated assets allocation, in the wake of renminbi globalization. The lecture took place at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) on 16 November 2017. The talk entitled \u201cPricing renminbi assets: the disruptive trends behind renminbi joining the ranks of international currencies\u201d was organized by HKUST Business School\u2019s Executive MBA for Chinese Executives (HKUST EMBA) Program, a world-class bilingual program specifically designed for Chinese speaking executives and entrepreneurs in Asia and the Greater China. In his talk, Prof Ba argued that it was inevitable for renminbi-denominated assets to integrate into the global financial market, as there was a demand for Chinese investors allocating assets overseas to share the profits of global economic growth. According to Prof Ba, overseas allocation was also vital for China\u2019s transformation of economic structure, and its solution to aging society. He expected a significant increase of renminbi-denominated assets in the global financial markets, thanks to the Belt and Road initiative. Hong Kong, as a global financial center connecting China and the rest of the world, played an important role as China was experimenting to make renminbi eventually a fully convertible international currency. The successes in the Shanghai/Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect all demonstrated an optimistic outlook in the internationalization of renminbi. Prof Xu Yan, Associate Dean of HKUST Business School, and Academic Director of HKUST EMBA for Chinese Executives Program said, \u201cWe are extremely grateful to Prof Ba for agreeing to give this lecture and share his vision on the globalization of renminbi and its implications to the role of Hong Kong. We have periodically invited visionary community leaders to share their insights with our EMBA students. This time we decided to open the classroom to our alumni, faculties, students from other programs and professional practitioners so that more people can be benefited from this feast for the mind, as the University endeavors to make positive social contribution through knowledge sharing.\u00a0 This is just the first one of our open classroom lecture series and the response was overwhelming. We are going to organize more in the future.\u201d "

    "text": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has launched a First-Year Experience @ Residence (FYE) Program \u2013 a new initiative in residence halls that aims to smooth first-year students\u2019 transition and adaptation to a new university life, and to engage freshmen in residential hall activities to foster an inclusive and caring learning environment. This pilot program is part of the University\u2019s continuing efforts to enhance students\u2019 residential life experience.\u00a0 Some 500 first-year students, of whom about a quarter are non-local students, will be offered a full year of on-campus residence.\u00a0 During when they will be taken care of by senior students called SUG (senior undergraduate) mentors, who will take the lead in helping hall mates bond and help freshmen familiarized themselves with the new environment. All first-year students are now guaranteed hall residence for one semester, upon implementation of this program,\u00a0the University will eventually ensure all new undergraduates have at least a year of stay in the student hostels on campus. HKUST Dean of Students Dr Robert Wessling said, \u201cI believe the process of education extends beyond the classroom \u2013 residential life plays an important role in each student\u2019s university education, it is the source of friendship, socializing, academic and emotional support. \u00a0I hope our newcomers could better adapt to their new life at HKUST through our new program, and that they could build long-lasting friendships, learn to value and respect differences, and harness the richness of ideas and perspectives for the benefit of the whole community.\u201d The University has provided training to 69 SUG mentors, covering mental health awareness, leadership and personal development skills.\u00a0 Each mentor will lead six to eight freshmen, whose composition is carefully planned to ensure diversity.\u00a0 These mentors, who themselves come from different schools and a variety of student teams and organizations, will guide their mentees through their personal, social and academic concerns, and bridge them to residence masters \u2013 faculty members who tailor programs for each hall, or to other channels when necessary.\u00a0 Mentoring groups will also form different learning communities and clusters among themselves to maximize the peer support. A study published in the Journal of College Student Development has shown that students involved in residential life community similar to FYE program have significantly higher levels of involvement in student societies and extracurricular activities (about 15% more), interaction with peers and faculty (about 5 to 10% more), as well as integration and gains in academic knowledge and intellectual development, than those who only reside in traditional residential halls without participating in such program. The program was kick started last week with HKUST\u2019s first-ever university-led orientation camp.\u00a0 Participants had a great time during the two-day camp as they mingled in games, campus tour, sharing and outings including boat trip and barbecue night.

    "text": "Researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) have developed a new generation of microscope, which not only could capture 3D live cell videos, but the resulted images are also of much higher quality, greatly enhancing the accuracy and the scope of research on cell biology. While an existing confocal microscope can also capture 3D bio-images, the laser light hitting on the sample is typically one million times that of summer sunlight, such intense light exposure inevitably disrupts cell activities and eventually kills the cell, posing limits to the study of cell biology. The LiTone Line Bessel Sheet (LBS) microscope invented by a team led by Prof Du Shengwang and Prof Michael Loy from HKUST, however, is 1,000 times less photo-toxic than the current confocal model, allowing the cell to live much longer for observation. Phototoxicity is a type of sensitivity induced by light, which could cause molecular changes. The new microscope is also about 1,000 times faster, allowing much higher temporal resolution for a smooth video taking. Scientists can then study how proteins are transported within cells with great accuracy and efficiency, and what happens when the cell becomes abnormal. Prof Du is a Professor from the Department of Physics and the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering; he is also the Associate Director of the Super-Resolution Imaging Center. Prof Loy is an Emeritus Professor of Physics. \u201cIt is a powerful technology out of sophisticated science and engineering, but we make it simple to users so that it can be operated by biologists with minimal amount of training,\u201d Prof Du said. \u201cFor the first time, scientists can study cells in much greater details. That could eventually help scientists unlock the mystery of how certain diseases were formed and developed in a cellular level.\u201d This new technology has been successfully transferred to Light Innovation Technology (LiT) Ltd, a startup co-founded by Prof Du, Prof Loy and their PhD students Dr Zhao Teng and Dr Zhao Luwei. LiT has won the Innovation Award and GF Securities Award in HKUST One Million Dollar Entrepreneurship Competition this year.

    "text": "A research team led by Prof SUN Fei, Assistant Professor of Chemical & Biological Engineering at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), has created a new protein-based stimuli-responsive smart hydrogel that could open doors for future material biology and biomedical applications. Hydrogels, also known as soft matter in the medical world, are leading materials for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and stem cell therapy. But traditional hydrogels, used in products such as facial masks and contact lenses, are made up of either synthetic polymers or biological extracts such as animal collagen, are likely to cause allergies. They cannot fully mimic the complex biological environment needed for cell growth and development. Not only is the new smart hydrogel developed by Prof Sun\u2019s team suitable to act as a carrier for stem cells which are key components for regenerative medicine, but also can control the time and manner regarding drug delivery inside human body due to its light sensing function. To create this novel hydrogel, the team assembled genetically-engineered proteins into molecular networks by stitching together the photoreceptor C-terminal adenosylcobalamin binding domain (CarHC) proteins at room temperature. The synthesis relies solely on bacterial culturing \u2013 a process similar to fermentation. The composition of the resulting hydrogel resembles that of human tissues and thus can be used to deliver live cells into human bodies while potentially minimizing allergies and body rejection. As a drug carrier, this photo-responsive hydrogel can quickly switch from solid to liquid upon light exposure, thus allowing drugs to be released into the body in a controlled manner. The strategy of creating entirely protein-based hydrogels represents a new way to design bioactive materials with precise control over their properties. The research findings were published in the journal PNAS on June 6, 2017. \u201cDemand for smart hydrogels is growing, the direct assembly of stimuli-responsive proteins into hydrogels opens up enormous opportunities not just for future material biology, but also medical treatment.\u201d Prof Sun said. \u201cIn theory, hydrogels can serve as carriers for stem cells in regenerative medicine to promote the healing of damaged organs, which means organ transplantation may no longer be patients\u2019 only solution in the future.\u201d About The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\nThe Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) (www.ust.hk) is a world-class research university focuses on science, technology and business as well as humanities and social science. HKUST offers an international campus, and a holistic and interdisciplinary pedagogy to nurture well-rounded graduates with global vision, a strong entrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking.
